\chapter{The parallel version}
\label{parallel}

%--#[ Introduction :

FORM has two versions that can make use of several processors 
simultaneously. Which version can be used profitably depends very much on 
the architecture of the computer one is using. Each version has its own 
control commands which are ignored by the other version and the sequential 
version of FORM. The parallel versions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item ParFORM\index{ParFORM}: This version runs on processors that have 
their own memory and preferably their own disk. Each processor gets a copy 
of the complete program and a system like MPI\index{MPI} is used for the 
communication\index{communication}. When the network connections are very 
fast one can also use ParFORM on clusters of workstations. ParFORM was 
developed at the university of Karlsruhe\index{Karlsruhe}.
\item TFORM\index{TFORM}: This version uses P-threads and runs on computers 
which have several processors with a shared memory. Data is kept as common 
data as much as possible and only when a worker thread gets a task a 
minimal amount of data is copied to its private buffers. Currently it seems 
to perform best on computers with two or four processors.
\end{itemize}
Both ParFORM and TFORM suffer from the same bottlenecks\index{bottleneck}. 
At the beginning of a module there is a single expression, managed by a 
master process which then has to distribute the terms over the workers. At 
the end of the module the sorted results of the workers have to be gathered 
in by the master\index{master} and merged into a single expression again. 
Efficiency depends critically on how fast the terms can be given to the 
workers\index{workers}, how well the load for the workers is balanced and 
how much time the master has to spend in the final stages of the sorting. 
Another factor is the complexity of the operations inside the module. If 
the module has very few and simple statements, the gain in performance will 
be much less than when the module has much work to do for each term.

The ParFORM and TFORM specific code is internally completely separated. 
This offers the possibility that sooner or later the two can be combined to 
allow efficient running on clusters of dual or quad processor machines. 
Whether this would give significant extra benefits needs to be 
investigated. When this project will be undertaken depends very much on the 
availability of such computers.

Because ParFORM uses protocols like MPI\index{MPI}, and because these 
protocols don't have rigorous standards (each platform seems to have its 
own variety), the port to new machines is often rather painful. Hence 
currently (year 2007) we don't have large numbers of executables ready in 
the distribution site. Ports will take place on demand and availability of 
time and resources. For TFORM the situation is much more favorable. Its 
treatment of the parallelization follows the standard for 
POSIX\index{POSIX} threads (or Pthreads) for which the libraries are 
implemented on almost any UNIX\index{UNIX} system and many other systems.

The ideal of a parallel version of FORM is that it should execute nearly 
any regular FORM program, whether it was written for parallelization or 
not. And it should execute much faster on several processors than the 
sequential version on a single processor. The performance is given by the 
improvement factor which is the execution time of the sequential version 
divided by the execution time of the parallel version as measured in real 
time (not CPU time) on a computer that has no other major tasks. The ideal 
would of course be that a computer with N processors would give an 
improvement factor of N. It should be easy to see that this ideal cannot be 
reached, due to the bottlenecks described above. Also the compilation takes 
place on a single processor and the instructions of the preprocessor are 
typically also tasks for a single thread/processor. Yet for small numbers 
of processors one can do rather well. Many old calculations, when repeated 
with TFORM would give improvement\index{improvement factor} factors above 
1.7 on a dual pentium\index{pentium} machine and around 3 or a bit higher 
on a quad opteron\index{opteron} machine. This was without modifying even a 
single statement in the programs. Of course these numbers depend very much 
on the type of the problem and the programming style used. As of yet there 
is very little experience with parallel versions of FORM. Hence people will 
have to discover what are good ways of getting the most out of their 
computer. It is expected that there will be much progress in the coming 
years.

First we will now discuss the running of the two versions. After that we 
will describe some common syntactic problems.

\section{TFORM}
\label{tform}

Let us assume that the executable of TFORM\index{TFORM} is called tform. It 
is used exactly the same way as the sequential version of FORM (named form) 
is used with the exception of the possibilty to specify the number of 
worker\index{worker} threads with the -w option. The command
\begin{verbatim}
    tform -w4 calcdia
\end{verbatim}
would execute the program in the file calcdia.frm, using 4 worker threads, 
in addition to the one master thread. When the -w option is not given or 
when only one worker thread is asked for, tform will run the whole program 
inside the master\index{master} thread. Because tform always has some 
overhead this is usually a little bit slower than using form. Strange 
enough there are exceptions although this may have to do with the fact that 
measuring the time of a program doesn't always give the same numbers.

It is also possible to specify the number of worker threads in the setup 
file, using the line
\begin{verbatim}
    Threads 4
\end{verbatim}
for 4 threads. And as with all setup parameters one can pass this 
information also via the environment variable FORM\_threads or with the line
\begin{verbatim}
    #: Threads 4
\end{verbatim}
at the beginning of the program file.

When the master passes terms to the workers, it has to signal\index{signal} 
the workers that there is some data. In their turn, each worker has to send 
the master a signal when it has completed its task and it is ready for 
more. Such signals cost time. Hence it is usually best to send terms in 
groups, called buckets\index{bucket}. The optimal number of terms in a 
bucket depends very much on the problem and the size of the expression. 
Bigger buckets mean less overhead in signals. If the buckets are too big 
the workers may have to wait too much. Values between 100 and 1000 are 
usually rather good. There is a default bucket size which is typically 
around 500. The user can change this value in two ways: The first is with 
the ThreadBucketSize\index{threadbucketsize} setup parameter in the 
form.set file (or at the startup of the program file, or with the 
FORM\_threadbucketsize environment variable) and the second is with the 
ThreadBucketSize statement (see \ref{substathreadbucketsize}) which is a 
declaration like Symbol or Dimension. The first terms in an expression will 
be sent in smaller buckets to get the workers something to do as soon as 
possible.

Usually the bigger buckets give a better performance, but they suffer from 
a nasty side-effect. Complicated terms that need much execution time have a 
tendency to stick together. Hence there can be one bucket with most of the 
difficult terms and at the end of the module all workers and the master 
have to wait for one worker to finish. This can be improved with a 
load\index{load balancing} balancing mechanism. The current version will 
take terms from the buckets of workers that take more time than the others. 
By default this mechanism is on, but it can be switched on or off with the 
`on ThreadLoadBalancing\index{threadloadbalancing};' and `off 
ThreadLoadBalancing;' statements. It can also be set as one of the setup 
parameters in the form.set file with
\begin{verbatim}
    ThreadLoadBalancing OFF
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
    ThreadLoadBalancing ON
\end{verbatim}
or at the start of the program or in the environment.

The LINUX\index{LINUX} operating system tries to cache\index{cache} files 
that are to be written to disk. Somehow, when several big files have to be 
written it gets all confused (it is not known in what way). This means that 
if tform produces 4 large sort files\index{file!sort} eventually the system 
becomes intolerably slow. At one time a test program was 4.5 times slower 
with 4 worker processors than with just the master running, even though the 
master had a single even bigger sort file. This has been improved by having 
the file-to-file sort of the threads changed into a 
file-to-masterbuffers-to-combined-output. Yet the writing and subsequent 
merging of the 4 files at the same time can be disastrous. Work is done to 
improve this, but it may not be easy to circumvent facilities of the 
operating system. Apparently the quality of the drivers is crucial here. 
%There is a variable that can force FORM to make sure that the part of the 
%file system that concerns the sort files is synchronized. This can be done 
%with
%\begin{verbatim}
%    ThreadSortFileSynch ON
%\end{verbatim}
%or
%\begin{verbatim}
%    ThreadSortFileSynch OFF
%\end{verbatim}
%or in the setup file with the variable threadsortfilesynch to be set either 
%on or off. Of course what can be done in the setup file can be done at the 
%start of the program as with
%\begin{verbatim}
%    #: ThreadSortFileSynch on
%\end{verbatim}
%or in the environment.

One can switch the parallel processing on or off (for the complete module) 
at any moment in the program with the 
statements\index{on!threads}\index{off!threads}
\begin{verbatim}
    On Threads;
    Off Threads;
\end{verbatim}
Additionally one can switch the statistics per thread on or off with
\begin{verbatim}
    On ThreadStats;
    Off ThreadStats;
\end{verbatim}
When the thread\index{on!threadstats}\index{on!threadstats} statistics are 
switched off only the statistics of the master thread are printed which is 
usually only the final statistics for each of the expressions.

The timing information in the statistics is the CPU\index{CPU time} time 
spent by the thread that prints the statistics. Hence the total CPU time 
spent is the sum of the time of all workers and the time of the master. In 
good running the time of the master should be the smallest number. When the 
statistics per thread are switched off, only the statistics of the master 
process will be printed with this `small' number. Hence it may look like 
the program isn't progressing very much.

For debugging purposes the term by term print\index{print} statement (see 
\ref{substaprint}) is equipped with the \verb:%W: and \verb:%w: format 
strings. The first will cause the printing of the number of the current 
thread and the CPU-time used thusfar in that thread. The second will only 
print the number of the current thread. The thread with the number zero is 
the master thread. Putting a statement like
\begin{verbatim}
    Print +f "<%W> %t";
\end{verbatim}
would show which thread is processing which term and when.

These are all the commands that specifically concern TFORM. When more 
experience is gained using TFORM, more parameters and commands may become 
available.

The fact that the threads need private\index{private} data makes that TFORM 
will use more memory than FORM. Most of the buffers are not very large, but 
of course there are some buffers which need to be large, like the sort 
buffers and the scratch input\index{input}/hide\index{hide} buffers. The 
sizes that the user specifies for these buffers are for the corresponding 
buffers of the master. The workers get each 1/N times the size for these 
buffers, when there are N workers. In the case that makes these buffers too 
small because of for instance MaxTermSize, the buffers may become larger.

\section{ParFORM}
\label{parform}

This section is still to be written. The current version does not have all 
its necessary commands running yet (as specified in the moduleoption 
statement \ref{substamoduleoption}). Keep tuned!

To be addressed:
\begin{itemize}
\item How to run ParFORM. Selection of processors.
\item How ParFORM runs (like one worker per processor and the master with 
its own processor and waiting in loops rather than working with wakup 
signals).
\item Special commands for controling its performance.
\item Buffer sizes.
\item etc.
\end{itemize}

\section{Some problems}

Both parallel versions share a number of problems which are inherent to 
running in an environment in which the order\index{order of terms} in which 
terms are processed isn't deterministic\index{deterministic}. Most of these 
problems concern \verb:$:-variables. They present a mix between private and 
common information. Consider the code
\begin{verbatim}
    id  f(x?$xvar) = g(x);
    id  ......
    id  a^n? = b^n*h($var);
\end{verbatim}
Of course one could do this simple example differently, but we are 
discussing the principle. What we have here is that each term that passes 
the first statement will acquire its own value of \verb:$var:, to be used a 
bit later. It is clear that if we have a common administration of 
\verb:$:-variables we would have to `lock'\index{lock} the value for a 
considerable amount of time, thereby spoiling much of the gains of parallel 
processing. Hence in this case it would be best that each worker maintains 
its own local value of \verb:$var:. But in the following example we have 
the opposite:
\begin{verbatim}
    #$xmax = -1;
    if ( count(x,1) > $xmax ) $xmax = count_(x,1);
\end{verbatim}
Here we collect a maximum power in the variable \verb:$xmax:. If each 
worker would have a local value of \verb:$xmax:, the question is what to do 
with all these local values at the end of the module. A human will see that 
here we are collecting a maximum, but the computer cannot and should not 
see this. Hence the general rule in parallel processing is that when there 
are \verb:$:-variables\index{\$-variable} obtaining a value during the 
algebraic phase of a module the entire module is run sequentially, unless 
FORM has been helped with a moduleoption statement for each of the 
variables involved. Hence in the last example
\begin{verbatim}
    ModuleOption Maximum $xmax;
\end{verbatim}
would tell FORM how to combine the local values in ParFORM (ParFORM 
maintains local values of all \verb:$:-variables). In TFORM it 
would put the value directly into the central administration, provided it 
is bigger than the previous value. Only during the update the variable 
would have to be locked.

There are several options in the moduleoption statement:
\begin{itemize}
\item Maximum\index{moduleoption!maximum}: The variable must have a 
numerical value and the maximum is collected.
\item Minimum\index{moduleoption!minimum}: The variable must have a 
numerical value and the minimum is collected.
\item Sum\index{moduleoption!sum}: The variable must have a numerical value 
and the sum is collected.
\item Local\index{moduleoption!local}: The value will be kept privately and 
no attempt is made to put it in the central administration, neither during 
the execution of the module, nor at the end. If there was already a 
variable by this name in the central administration it will keep the value 
it had before the module started execution. At the end of the module, all 
private values will be forgotten.
\end{itemize}

%Currently the only other way in which FORM switches automatically to its 
%sequential mode for the entire module is when the redefine statement is 
%detected by the compiler. The redefine statement makes FORM to change the 
%value of a global object (a preprocessor variable) which cannot be done 
%reliably. For this there is no solution. The best way around it is using 
%\verb:$:-variables and preprocessor instructions. We show this in an 
%example in which we construct the equivalent of a conditional repeat that 
%includes a .sort instruction:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    #do i = 1,1
%      statements
%      if ( count(x,1) > 0 ) redefine i "0";
%      .sort
%    #enddo
%\end{verbatim}
%To run this in parallel, one could use
%\begin{verbatim}
%    #do i = 1,1
%      #$i = 1;
%      statements
%      if ( count(x,1) > 0 ) $i = 0;
%      ModuleOption minimum $i;
%      .sort
%      #redefine i "`$i'"
%    #enddo
%\end{verbatim}
%Admitedly this isn't as simple as the redefine statement, but it works in 
%all versions of \FORM\ starting with version 3.0.

It should be noted that when a new expression is defined in its defining 
module it starts out as a single term. Hence it cannot benefit from 
parallelization in that module. Therefore the code
\begin{verbatim}
    #define MAX "200"
    Symbols x0,...,x10;
    Local F = (x0+...+x`MAX')^3;
    id x1 = -x2-...-x`MAX';
    .end
\end{verbatim}
will execute inside a single worker while
\begin{verbatim}
    #define MAX "200"
    Symbols x0,...,x10;
    Local F = (x0+...+x`MAX')^3;
    .sort
    id x1 = -x2-...-x`MAX';
    .end
\end{verbatim}
will make the first expansion inside a single worker and the more costly 
subsitution can be made in parallel. A better load\index{load balancing} 
balancing algorithm in which at any node in the expansion tree tasks can be 
given to idle workers would solve this problem, but due to some 
complications this has not yet been implemented. The structure of FORM will 
however allow such an implementation.
%\footnote{In the year 1991 version 1 of FORM was parallelized on a 
%computer at FNAL along these lines. It was however rather primitive and 
%lack of access to suitable computers stopped further development at that 
%moment.}
