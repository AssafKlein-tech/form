FORM is a Symbolic Manipulation System. It reads symbolic expressions from files
and executes symbolic/algebraic transformations upon them. The answers are
returned in a textual mathematical representation. As its landmark feature, the
size of the considered expressions in FORM is only limited by the available
disk space and not by the available RAM.

FORM's original author is Jos Vermaseren of NIKHEF, the Dutch institute for
subatomic physics. Other people that have made contributions can be found in the
file "[AUTHORS](AUTHORS)".
